# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Challenge 13: React Portfolio

For this challenge, you will utilize what you have learned in `Module 13: React` to develop the initial scaffolding of your portfolio sites.

Now that you've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, it's time to develop the initial scaffolding for your first portfolio site as well as create and/or update other materials so that you can showcase your skills to potential employers. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.

## Instructions

* Students must fullfil the requirements listed in the following sections:

### Design

Remember, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look "polished" and "professional". Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

### Base Requirements

      * [ ] Project title
      * [ ] Link to the deployed version
      * [ ] Link to the GitHub repository
      * [ ] GIF or screenshot of the deployed application

### Required Components

  * [ ] Must render dynamically 6 instances of the Project component
    * [ ] Be sure to store your project data in a JSON file and import it into your project
* [ ] Project:

   * [ ] Must utilize router props to properly render the right project based on user selection
   * [ ] Must render the following info:
     * [ ] Project title
     * [ ] Link to the deployed version
